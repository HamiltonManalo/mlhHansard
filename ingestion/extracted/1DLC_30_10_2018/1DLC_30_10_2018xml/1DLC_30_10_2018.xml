purpose of the draft order is to bring the public functions of the
National Police Chiefs Council within the scope of the Freedom of
Information Act. That is to ensure continuity in the scope of the Act
by extending it to the council in the same way as it included the
predecessor organisation, the Association of Chief Police
Officers<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000008" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000008">As
to the detail of the draft order, section 5(1)(a) of the Freedom of
Information Act 2000, as amended, enables the Secretary of State to
designate any person as a public authority if they appear to the
Secretary of State to exercise functions of a public nature. Where a
body is designated as a public authority, it is also
necessary—under section 7(5) of the Act—to specify each
of the body’s functions as appear to the Secretary of State to
be of a public nature. Only those functions specified in the schedule
in relation to article 3 of this order will be subject to the
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:31:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000009" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000009">As
with the ACPO, it appears to the Secretary of State that the NPCC
exercises functions of a public nature in relation to all its
functions. The council provides national police co-ordination and
leadership, and brings together police forces throughout the UK, as
well as in the armed services and the Crown dependencies. Some of the
council’s co-ordination and leadership functions are delivered
in conjunction with the College of Policing, the professional body that
provides the policing skills and knowledge necessary to prevent crime
and to protect the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000010" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000010">The
functions set out in the draft order reflect those in clause 7 of the
collaboration agreement that established the NPCC. The Secretary of
State considers that each of those functions makes a fundamental
contribution to the policing of the state in such a way that they are,
together and individually, functions of a public nature that are
eligible for inclusion in an order made under section 5 of the Freedom
of Information
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000011" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000011">I
confirm that the NPCC has been consulted about the functions covered in
the draft order. It views its inclusion under the Freedom of
Information Act positively and is in agreement with the Secretary of
State about the scope of the order. We welcome the constructive way in
which the NPCC has engaged with the Home Office in drawing up the
order<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:32:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

designating the NPCC, this draft instrument removes the designation of
ACPO. That is a question of legislative tidying up, because ACPO has
been liquidated and no longer exists. This amendment will update the
statute book to reflect that. The liquidators of ACPO were consulted,
as required, and are
content<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:33:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000013" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000013">I
recognise that the draft order has taken some time to get to this
stage. I made a statement on 6 November last year that the Government
would introduce an order to ensure continuity in transparency following
the winding up of ACPO and the taking on of its functions by the NPCC.
As I have mentioned, there has been a statutory consultation with the
new body to ensure that all necessary functions were covered by this
order as
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000014" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000014">I
should make it clear that the NPCC ensured against any retraction in
transparency during the transition period, when taking over the
functions of ACPO. The council publishes large amounts of information
proactively and responded to information requests voluntarily during
the short period that it was not formally covered by the Freedom of
Information Act. I am sure the Committee agrees that that is highly
commendable<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000015" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000015">The
draft order builds on the solid foundations of the order that brought
ACPO under the Freedom of Information Act by providing a legally
enforceable right to request information of the NPCC. I hope that hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee agree that the order is an
important step to maintaining transparency, and that they welcome the
new rights of access to information that it will
bring<hs_TimeCode time="2018-10-30T14:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="18103032000029" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000029">2.34

previous Labour Government introduced the Freedom of Information Act,
and the Opposition wholeheartedly support the draft order. As the
Minister suggested, he responded to my parliamentary question back in
September, so Labour has been calling for the measure for some time, as
has the NPCC. As he rightly said, the NPCC has been behaving as if it
were already covered by the Act, which we agree is thoroughly
commendable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000018" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000018">I
want to push the Minister on his point about the information that the
NPCC publishes proactively and question the extent to which the Home
Office can require information to be published or the NPCC to respond.
For example, in the past 18 months or so, the NPCC has been collating
and publishing information on acid attacks. I believe there is a
commitment to continue publishing such information. Was that at the
request of the Home Office? Is the NPCC obligated under any statutory
instrument to publish such information at the request of the
Government?</hs_Para>

published statistics on Operation Hydrant, which is the investigation
into historical child sex abuse, but the statistics it is publishing
are headline stats on the number of individuals involved. How often is
the NPCC required to report on that? What elements should it be
reporting on? For example, should it be reporting on the progress or
length of the investigations?</hs_Para>

reports on automatic number plate recognition and its functions. Is
that a Home Office request, too, under proactive publication? Given the
reasons it publishes on ANPR—the invasion of people’s 
<?notus-xml column=5?>individual privacy—would it not be beneficial for it to report on
facial recognition and the implications for privacy and security? It is

will the Minister confirm that the extension of the Freedom of

Government? For instance, does it cover the letter that the NPCC
reportedly sent to the Treasury last Tuesday, threatening legal action
on the basis of the Government’s proposed pension changes? I

Hurd:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady for her support and her
constructive approach. It has taken too long to get to this point.
While I think we can all agree on that, I hope we all also agree that
the NPCC is now formally bound into the Freedom of Information Act. It
is a particular pleasure to see the chair of the NPCC gracing us with
her presence today. She missed the recognition 
<?notus-xml column=6?>from all parts of the Committee of the extremely constructive and
commendable way in which the council has behaved in this interim
period.</hs_Para>

statutory obligation to publish statistics. I am not aware of any
specific requests from the Home Office, but I will check and reply to
the hon. Lady. As I pointed out, the NPCC already voluntarily behaves
as if it is covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Since 2012, ACPO
and the NPCC have, on average, received 250 to 300 requests a year. If
the legislation is passed, it will take effect almost immediately. The
NPCC will then be covered by existing
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000024" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000024">What
is available to the public to request is as per the rules. The hon.
Lady can be congratulated on her cheeky and opportunistic attempt to
bring up the issue of police funding and pensions, but there is no need
for the public to request that under the Freedom of Information Act
because they can simply read about it in the
newspaper.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18103032000025" tab="yes" url="../pa/cm/cmhansrd/cm181030/debtext/181030-0001.htm#18103032000025"><I>Question
